## Programming Languages
- C (see [gameoflife-c](https://github.com/ilovapples/gameoflife-c) ) (getting better, I hope)

## Web-Dev/Markup Languages
(please note I have not used any of these for over a year)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (?)

(plus I play Minecraft)

## Learning (at some point)
- [Java](https://java.com) (learned the syntax for Minecraft modding, should probably learn the standard library for AP CS)
- [C++](https://www.isocpp.org) (still learning, because it's hard)
- [Go](https://go.dev) (seems fun)
